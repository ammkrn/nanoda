## This is a development branch.

It's currently functional (see `docs/changelog` for some more info) though may be unsound. I wasn't able to get lean4 to do anything since I don't know how cmake works, but I operated on the assumption that `Projection`, `Theorem` and `Opaque` work like more nuanced definitions that are explicitly declared as such in lean4 export files. Not knowing C++, I wasn't able to figure out in any detail how `local_ctx` and `FVar` are supposed to work, so I'm not sure whether using `Local`s as a stand-in has introduced any large correctness issues.
