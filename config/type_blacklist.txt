# The macros in this crate automatically try to trace
# function arguments and return types. In some cases, this
# behavior is not desirable IE for very large types, or types
# like Env. By placing those types' names in this file,
# we can tell the tracing macros that we want to ignore those
# types when they appear in the argument or return position.
# A list of types we want to avoid is hard coded in the macro,
# so unless you modify the checker's source code, you shouldn't
# have to use this file.
